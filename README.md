### :warning: After November 20th, 2023 the application will most likely no longer be accessible because the free tier of the database being used to store the application's data will have expired.


## About
I created this application in three weeks as a way to familiarize myself with the Ruby on Rails framework. I tried to emulate the base features and appearance of the popular online job board website which inspired LonkedOn. All jobs and companies listed in the application are fictional.

I have populated the website with fake users and myself. For security and management reasons, I am not allowing any new user accounts to be created. However, you can watch what the user experience is like in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40PpYuyoNvs).

The application uses a PostgreSQL database hosted on render.com. The application's image data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.
